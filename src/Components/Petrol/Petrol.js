                The waiting is over! The Superfast Token PETROL is finally
                there! PETROL is the substance that moves our game forward.

              <p className="ps-lg-5 ps-2">
                It’s as simple as this: The more NFTs the more Tokens! With
                every NFT you buy, you receive a certain amount of PETROL that
                you can use to play games, trade or buy more NFTs, or enjoy
                other benefits within the game.

                All those who purchased Superfast.cards NFTs prior to the launch
                of PETROL or received them via a promotion also received PETROL
                on a proportionate basis at launch. You can read details below

            works:

                    <p>The Superfast.Cards Token PETROL will be deeply tied into the game’s ecosystem. PETROL will eventually become deflationary and players/holders will be incentivized to hold, causing natural price growth, this will be achieved in the following ways:</p>
                    <p>PETROL will be required as the primary form of in-game currency. Players will need PETROL to pay for Ingame Upgrades, game fees, Marketplace purchases, and more. Additionally, the “PETROL Treasury” will eventually buy and burn PETROL, making it naturally deflationary as the ecosystem grows.</p>
                    <p>PETROL will eventually provide holders with the opportunity to actively participate in the future directions of the game! The project will slowly and safely shift from an initial structure to a fully decentralized online game. PETROL holders will be able to participate in governance voting in the future as part of an upcoming DAO/DAC, allowing them to shape the future of Superfast.Cards.</p>
                    <p>The maximum supply of PETROL is 500,000,000, while only 10% (50,000,000) was initially circulated. 1 PETROL is equal to 100 DROPS. The initial market cap listing price was $0.01. PETROL is already listed at <span>Quickswap</span>  – but it is planned to be listed at other Exchanges in the future (e.g. KUKOIN). In addition, PETROL will be listed at coinmarketcap.</p>
